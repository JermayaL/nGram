# nGram
In 2012, nearly 100% of exact matches were true to the keyword, but by 2024, this has dropped to only 50%. Similarly, phrase match has seen a steep decline, from nearly 100% in 2012 to less than 25% in 2024. Broad match, on the other hand, hasn't changed much, but since 2020, the broadening has significantly increased, making it highly unlikely that your search terms will contain your keywords.

This is why nGram analysis and reacting to it is more important than ever. And I use it more and more within my accounts. By comparing performance over 30, 60 and 90 days you can make better decisions.

For instance, I have automated exclusion lists set at the campaign level using nGram over a longer period.
